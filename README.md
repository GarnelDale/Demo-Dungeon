# Overview
This is a short, one dungeon game with hazards and collectibles. Collect all 5 gems and make it to the escape point to win! 

I wrote this short game to explore the different capabilites of the Python Arcade engine and to explore which part of video game design and development I enjoy the most. As such, I made as many of the art assets as I had time for and wrote the music for the game. I chose the Arcade engine because it gave me the opportunity to continue practicing my understanding of the Python language.
